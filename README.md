# Headline-Generator-by-Markov-Chain
This project is a Streamlit web application that generates random, meaningful headlines using a Markov Chain model. Whether you're looking for creative inspiration, building a parody news generator, or just having fun, this tool leverages the power of natural language processing to create unique and coherent headlines.
## Live Demo

## Features
✨ Pre-trained Model: Use a Markov chain model to generate headlines instantly.  
✨ Custom Training: Upload your own text data (e.g., news articles, blog posts) to train a new model.  
✨ State Size Control: Adjust the Markov chain's state size for more or less randomness in the generated headlines.  
✨ Export Headlines: Download the generated headlines as a text file for further use.  

## How It Works
Markov Chains: The app uses Markov chains to model the probability of word sequences based on input text data.

Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly web interface allows you to generate headlines, upload custom data, and visualize the model.

Customization: Train the model on your own dataset and adjust parameters to fine-tune the output.

## Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.

Markovify: Library for building and using Markov chain models.

Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web apps.

Pandas: Data processing for uploaded CSV files.
